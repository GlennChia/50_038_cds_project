live\\ra carbon-neutral life.\\rThose of you who are good at branding,\\rI\\'d love to get your advice and help\\ron how to say this in a way\\rthat connects with the most people.\\rIt is easier than you think.\\rIt really is.\\rA lot of us in here\\rhave made that decision,\\rand it is really pretty easy.\\rIt means reduce\\ryour carbon dioxide emissions\\rwith the full range\\rof choices that you make,\\rand then purchase or acquire offsets\\rfor the remainder that you have not\\rcompletely reduced.\\rAnd what it means is elaborated\\rat climatecrisis.net.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r10:26\\r\\r\\rThere is a carbon calculator.\\rParticipant Productions convened \\rwith my active involvement \\rthe leading software writers in the world,\\ron this arcane science\\rof carbon calculation,\\rto construct a consumer-friendly\\rcarbon calculator.\\rYou can very precisely calculate\\rwhat your CO2 emissions are,\\rand then you will be given\\roptions to reduce.\\rAnd by the time the movie\\rcomes out in May,\\rthis will be updated to 2.0,\\rand we will have click-through\\rpurchases of offsets.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r11:06\\r\\r\\rNext, consider making\\ryour business carbon-neutral.\\rAgain, some of us have done that,\\rand it\\'s not as hard as you think.\\rIntegrate climate solutions\\rinto all of your innovations,\\rwhether you are from the technology,\\ror entertainment, or design\\rand architecture community.\\rInvest sustainably.\\rMajora mentioned this.\\rListen, if you have invested money\\rwith managers who you compensate\\ron the basis of their annual performance,\\rdon\\'t ever again complain\\rabout quarterly report CEO management.\\rOver time, people do\\rwhat you pay them to do.\\rAnd if they judge how much\\rthey\\'re going to get paid\\ron your capital that they\\'ve

with some\\rof the personal stories obviously replaced\\rwith a generic approach,\\rand it\\'s not just the slides,\\rit\\'s what they mean.\\rAnd it\\'s how they link together.\\rAnd so I\\'m going to be conducting\\ra course this summer\\rfor a group of people that are\\rnominated by different folks\\rto come and then give it en masse,\\rin communities all across the country,\\rand we\\'re going to update the slideshow\\rfor all of them every single week,\\rto keep it right on the cutting edge.\\rWorking with Larry Lessig, it will be,\\rsomewhere in that process,\\rposted with

well.\\rThis used to be a bipartisan issue,\\rand I know that\\rin this group it really is.\\rBecome politically active.\\rMake our democracy work the way\\rit\\'s supposed to work.\\rSupport the idea of capping\\rcarbon dioxide emissions \\rglobal warming pollution \\rand trading it.\\rHere\\'s why: as long as the United States\\ris out of the world system,\\rit\\'s not a closed system.\\rOnce it becomes a closed system,\\rwith U.S. participation,\\rthen everybody\\rwho\\'s on a board of directors \\rhow many people here\\rserve on the board of directors\\rof a corporation?\\rOnce it\\'s a closed system,\\ryou will have legal liability\\rif you do not urge your CEO\\rto get the maximum income from reducing\\rand trading the carbon emissions\\rthat can be avoided.\\rThe market will work\\rto solve this problem \\rif we can accomplish this.\\rHelp with the mass persuasion campaign\\rthat will start this spring.\\rWe have to change the minds\\rof the American people.\\rBecause

    "sample_ls = [\"As New Yorkers, we're often busy looking up at the development going on around us. We rarely stop to consider what lies beneath the city streets. And it's really hard to imagine that this small island village would one day become a forest of skyscrapers. Yet, as an urban archaeologist, that's exactly what I do. I consider landscapes, artifacts to tell the stories of the people who walked these streets before us. Because history is so much more than facts and figures. When people think of archaeology, they usually think of dusty old maps, far off lands, ancient civilizations. You don't think New York City and construction sites. Yet, that's where all the action happens and we're never sure exactly what we're going to find beneath the city streets. Like this wooden well ring which was the base for the construction of a water well. It provided us an opportunity to take a sample of the wood for tree-ring dating, and get a date to confirm the fact that we had indeed found a series of 18th-century structures beneath Fulton Street. Archaeology is about everyday people using everyday objects, like the child who may have played with this small toy, or the person who consumed the contents of this bottle. This bottle contained water imported from Germany and dates to 1790. Now okay, we know New Yorkers always had to go to great lengths to get fresh drinking water. Small island, you really couldn't drink the well water, it was to brackish. But the notion that New Yorkers were importing bottled water from Europe, more then two hundred years ago, is truly a testament to the fact that New York City is a cosmopolitan city, always has been, where you could get practically anything from anywhere. If you and I were to walk through City Hall Park, you might see an urban park and government offices. I see New York City's largest and most complex archaeological site. And it's significant not because it's City Hall, but because of the thousands of poor prisoners and British soldiers who lived and died here. Before it was City Hall Park, the area was known as The Common, and it was pretty far outside the city limits. In the 17th century, it was a place for public protests and execution. \"]\n",
